Gherman received his Master's degree in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2017. His first research experience was in experimental biology when he studied cellular stresses due to inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory process. Switching to computational biology, he explored the molecular evolution of respiratory chain enzymes, trying to track them back to the universal common ancestor of all living organisms. After joining the Wasserman research group, Gherman began his research in genome regulation field. He has a keen passion for understanding the key mechanisms of the differentiation of stem cells towards different lineages and potential applications of this in the regenerative medicine domain. He is interested in machine and deep learning methods and strongly believes that combining biological and computational expertise are the best ways to succeed in his research project.
