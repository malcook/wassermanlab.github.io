Phillip Richmond has had a passion for Genomics since 2010, where he got his start in yeast genomics studying genotypic effects of directed evolution in Robin Dowell's lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder (USA). He gained experience in other model organisms across fields of cancer and behavioral genetics. In 2015, he started his PhD in Bioinformatics at UBC with the Wasserman lab, focusing on ways to expand the utility of whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders. He has a special interest in improving and benchmarking methods for variant detection and interpretation, with an emphasis on short tandem repeat expansions. He is also a part of an international collaboration which focuses on finding prognostic markers of cerebral demyelination in X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy. Beyond research, Phillip has a passion for teaching and leadership, and has developed and taught open source courses in genome analysis for GenomeBC's GeneSkool, Compute Canada, and UBC Advanced Research Computing. He is a co-founder and chair of the BCCHR Trainee Omics Group, an initiative which focuses on training programming and analysis methods for "omics" data. Lastly, as he has a passion for building community and improving trainee experiences at BCCHR, he has served as the BCCHR Trainee Council chair since 2017.
