Bhavi has a keen interest and passion for understanding disease mechanisms in human genetic disorders. She completed her Ph.D. in Human Genetics from the Virginia Commonwealth University (USA) in Dec 2016. Her doctoral research focused on investigating the genetic mechanisms of complex reproductive disorders and pregnancy complications. Her current postdoctoral research in Turvey and Wasserman labs focuses on utilizing applied genome analysis methods towards the study of rare genetic disorders. This collaborative environment allows her to integrate next-generation sequencing and analysis techniques with biological theory for a more functionally informative approach that has a better chance of impacting healthcare management. Her work is driven by a passion to help families going through diagnostic odysseys - a passion that is fueled by personal experiences. Beyond the lab and research, she is an active advocate for creating an equal opportunity environment for young girls and women to pursue careers in STEM. To support this vision, she has been a Board Director for the Society for Canadian Women in Science & Technology (SCWIST) in the past and continues to volunteer with the organization.
