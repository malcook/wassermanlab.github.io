Tamar is interested in using computer science approaches to analyze biological data. She completed her BSc in 2019 at the University of British Columbia where she studied Computer Science and Microbiology. In the past she has had wet lab experience, in the lab of Dr. Steven Hallam, where she engineered artificial bacterial strains to break down lignocellulosic biomass. Tamar also spent 4 months as a computational biology intern at A*Star's Genome Institute of Singapore where she worked with Dr. Niranjan Nagarajan on analyzing microbial communities sampled from hospital environments.
