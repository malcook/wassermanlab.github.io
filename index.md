title: Wasserman Lab

Welcome to the Wasserman Lab website! Headed by Dr. Wyeth Wasserman, professor in Medical Genetics at the University of British Columbia and Executive Director of Research at BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute. The lab is in Vancouver, British Columbia where the ocean meets the mountains. 

The Wasserman lab focuses on the creation, evaluation and application of computational methods for the analysis of genome sequences, with international strength in the study of cis-regulatory elements regulating gene expression. The lab creates widely used software and databases, performs applied analyses of genome sequences, and partners with diverse research teams on projects at the intersection of the computational and life sciences. Current research projects draw upon deep learning and related machine learning methods to use the power of modern computers to detect properties in genomics “big data”.
