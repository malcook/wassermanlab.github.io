    Our team is constantly changing. The students and post-docs in the group have historically done well, with alumni working in both industry and academia. We take pride in teamwork and maintaining a positive research environment. Opportunities are always available for exceptional students and post-docs. Computer programming skills are essential—we work in a linux/Macintosh environment and develop our own software.
    <br><br>
    Post-doc candidates with good publication records are strongly encouraged to apply. Graduate students should consider the UBC Bioinformatics Graduate Program, although on occasion we directly accept students with demonstrated interest in our research. Motivated undergraduate students with strong computer skills are welcomed, particularly during the summer (May-August). In all cases early contact is best—it gives us time to plan for space, resources and the scientific project.
