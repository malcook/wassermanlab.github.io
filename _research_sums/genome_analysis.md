Genome Sequencing has disrupted health research. The lab has been developing computational methods and tools to allow researchers and clinicians to identify functional consequences of genetic variations within the human genome. Engaging with patients and clinicians both locally through BC Children’s Hospital, and abroad through international collaborations, the Wasserman lab has enabled the diagnosis, and in some cases treatment, of previously undiagnosed cases. As DNA sequencing technology has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of rare genetic disorders, the Wasserman lab has embarked on an endeavour to make the technology available to currently underrepresented populations, namely the indigenous populations of Canada.
